# OttawaGameJam2015
Unity project containing a small test game I created in 3 days with a few other colleagues. Incorporates Oculus Rift VR.

Repo contains all scripts used in the game, compiled from various sources online and applied to our game format. 
  Some include standard assets included in Unity.
